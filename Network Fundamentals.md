## OBJ 1.2 - Network Components
---
Clients - any device connected to the network

Servers - provide resources to the network, can be a dedicated hardware device or a software

Hubs - Older tech, connects devices over a local area network, limited by network errors due to how they are broadcasted. Evolved into bridges and now switches

Switches - advanced hubs, provides more security and efficient bandwidth utilization.

WAP (WAPs/APs) - lets wireless devices connect to a wired network, common in homes and businesses/offices

Routers - crucial component, used to let different networks communicate / connect
Modern routers rely on IP/internet protocol

Firewalls - security barrier for the internal network to anything external. Controls ingoing/outgoing traffic

Load Balancers - devices/software that distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers. Prevents any one server from bottlenecking

Proxy - acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet. Web filtering, shared network connections, data caching, offers privacy

IDS - Intrusion Detection Systems detect unauthorized access or network anomalies and alerts admins

IPS - Intrusion Prevention detects threats like IDS, but will take action to prevent intrusion

Controllers - in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) context, they are the central units that manage flow control to networking devices, allows network admins to dictate network switches/routers behavior thru software

NAS - Network-attached Storage devices are dedicated file storage systems that provide data access to a similar group of clients

SAN - Storage Area Networks are high speed networks that provide access to consolidated block level data storage, designed to handle large volumes of data and is supposed to help disk arrays and data libraries and make the data accessible to the servers

Media - refers to physical materials to transmit data, cables and stuff like that

WAN - Wide Area Network links are used to connect networks over large geographical areas
